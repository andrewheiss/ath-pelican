* Ongoing series of minimalist photo books

Since we got married in 2005, Nancy and I have taken tens of thousands of pictures (spending so much time in the Middle East has probably been a major reason for this :)). Sadly, those pictures sit and gather virtual dust on several hard drives, so in an effort to do something useful with them, we created the *One Thousand Words* series of photo books. 

The books are available at Lulu:

* [Volume I: In the beginningâ€¦](http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/one-thousand-words-in-the-beginning-%28vol-1%29/2307876?productTrackingContext=center_search_results)
* [Volume II: Adventures in Jordan](http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/one-thousand-words-adventures-in-jordan-%28vol-2%29/3102564?productTrackingContext=center_search_results)
