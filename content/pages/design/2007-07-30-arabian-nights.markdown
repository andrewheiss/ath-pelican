From 2006â€“08 I taught regular classes on InDesign at the Multimedia Lab at the BYU Library. One of my classes focused on using InDesign to typeset and layout a full book. I generally had my students work on *Aesop's Fables* or something else in the public domain from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ "Project Gutenberg"). After months of throwing away temporary example InDesign projects, I decided to finally complete an actual book.

So, I typeset Andrew Lang's 1898 text of *Arabian Nights' Entertainments* since it was relevant to my other passion, Middle Eastern Studies (the book's classic Orientalism aside :)). I was able to use Arabic type in both InDesign and Illustrator with the standard version of CS3 (not CS3 ME) by using [a cool little trick I invented.](http://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2007/09/17/using-arabic-in-indesign-without-indesign-me/ "Using Arabic in InDesign without InDesign ME")
