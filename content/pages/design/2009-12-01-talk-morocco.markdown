* WordPress blog + CMS
* Localized and internationalized

Talk Morocco is a site that promotes international discussion on political, economic, religious, and moral issues facing Morocco, and features a monthly topical forum with articles by various contributors in several languages. I was given the basic site design and built it [in-browser](http://24ways.org/2009/make-your-mockup-in-markup) as a WordPress template. While the site appears to be a basic blog, it took some crazy hacking to get the articles to be arranged by forum, rather than as one big loop of posts. 

Articles that are written in Arabic or French are translated into English by volunteers and both versions are posted. Eventually I'll fully localize the entire site into Arabic and French using [qTranslate](http://www.qianqin.de/qtranslate/) or an equivalent [i18n](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization) plugin.
