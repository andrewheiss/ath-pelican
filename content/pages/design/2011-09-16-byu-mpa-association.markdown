* Runs on Drupal 6
* Central hub for MPA students, alumni, and faculty
* Unique topical blog

As part of BYU's Romney Institute of Public Management's new strategic vision, I was charged to create a website that would allow the Institute to connect with (1) current students and faculty, (2) alumni and community leaders, and (3) the world. The site uses a typical blog to make announcements and give updates on MPA activities, projects, and research. It also has an innovative topical blog called "The Caucus," modeled after [Talk Morocco's](http://www.talkmorocco.net/) topical format, where alumni, students, and community leaders can chime in on relevant topics in public administration. 

The site runs on Drupal 6 and is fairly simple, with several custom content types that run the front page rotating banner, the blog, and the Caucus.
