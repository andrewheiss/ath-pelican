Description: Andrew Heiss teaches courses in graphic design, data visualization, statistics, public policy analysis, and Middle East politics.

I believe that university teaching should challenge and shift how students understand the world. As a teacher, I believe that students can grapple with these big ideas only when teaching materials are grounded in real world concerns, when courses are designed with student needs in mind, and when students are actively engaged in the learning process. [I describe my philosophy for teaching in this brief statement](/files/teaching/2016-08-31-andrew-heiss-teaching-statement.pdf).

My teaching and research experience has prepared me to teach courses in international relations, comparative politics, political institutions, Middle East politics, policy analysis, science communication, and both qualitative and qualitative research methods. I have also given more than a dozen workshops and lectures to doctoral and masters students at Duke on data visualization, science communication, reproducible research, and data-centered programming and version control.

I have had many opportunities to assist with teaching and act as an instructor of record in many undergraduate and graduate courses, including the following:
