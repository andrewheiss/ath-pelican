## Abstract

The past two decades have seen a proliferation of laws targeted at non-governmental organizations (NGOs), resulting in an increasingly restricted space for these organizations to provide services or engage in advocacy. How do Western donors respond to this legal crackdown on NGOs? We use original data on civil society restrictions across all official aid recipients from 1981–2012 to assess the impact of these restrictions on total flows of foreign aid, how aid is distributed, and which issues are funded. We find that additional legal barriers on NGO political advocacy decrease the amount of foreign given to restrictive countries. Additionally, we find that donors redirect funds within restrictive countries and decrease funding for politically sensitive causes in favor of tamer issues that are more compatible with the governments of those countries. Finally, we find that donors—USAID in particular—channel more aid to domestic rather than foreign NGOs in order to assuage target country concerns about external interference in domestic politics. The implications of these findings are worrisome for both Western donors, which channel a large amount of foreign aid through NGOs, and for NGOs, many of which are unable to sustain themselves without financial support from abroad.
