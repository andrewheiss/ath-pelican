Description: Andrew Heiss studies international NGOs, global governance, authoritarian regimes, and the Middle East.

My dissertation, "Amicable Contempt: The Strategic Balance between Dictators and International NGOs," looks at:

1. how authoritarian regimes regulate international NGOs, and
2. how international NGOs respond to those regulations.

View the theory and (forthcoming) data for the first and second halves of the project at [ingorestrictions.org](http://ingorestrictions.org/) and [ingoresearch.org](https://www.ingoresearch.org/).
