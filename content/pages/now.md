* Settling into Atlanta as I start a new job as an assistant professor in the [Department of Public Management and Policy](https://aysps.gsu.edu/public-management-policy/) at the [Andrew Young School of Policy Studies](https://aysps.gsu.edu/) at [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu/)
* Teaching [program evaluation](https://evalsp20.classes.andrewheiss.com/), and [microeconomics](https://econf19.classes.andrewheiss.com/) at the [Andrew Young School of Policy Studies](https://aysps.gsu.edu/) at [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu/) during the 2019â€“20 academic year
* Converting my dissertation into multiple articles and sending them out to journals + continuing [my research on authoritarianism and international NGOs](https://www.ingoresearch.org/)
