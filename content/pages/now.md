* Writing my dissertation on [international NGOs and authoritarianism](https://www.ingorestrictions.org) ([code](https://github.com/andrewheiss/Dissertation))
* Applying for academic jobs in political science, international relations, public policy, and public administration
* Working as an RA for my [dissertation adviser](https://sanford.duke.edu/people/faculty/kelley-judith) ([code](https://github.com/andrewheiss/jk_misc))
* Reading some sort of religiously themed text every day ([books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2733632-andrew-heiss?shelf=religious))
