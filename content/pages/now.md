Description: Andrew Heiss is working on a bunch of exciting and groundbreaking projects

As of August 1, 2017, I'm spending all my time on these things:

* Raising 4.5 kids (10, 7.5, 5, 2, −13 weeks) and trying to stay sane ([family blog](http://www.heissatopia.com/))
* Preparing to teach courses on data visualization, telling stories with data, and microeconomics at the [Romney Institute of Public Management](https://marriottschool.byu.edu/mpa/) at [Brigham Young University](https://home.byu.edu/home/) during the 2017–18 academic year
* Making final revisions to my dissertation on [international NGO&#8288;s and authoritarianism](https://www.ingorestrictions.org) ([code](https://github.com/andrewheiss/Dissertation))
* Working on several articles on NGO restrictions with [Suparna Chaudhry](http://www.suparnachaudhry.com/)
* Working on a book chapter on NGO&#8288;s and authoritarianism
* Reading some sort of religiously themed text every day ([books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2733632-andrew-heiss?shelf=religious))
