As of August 28, 2020, I'm spending all my time on these things:

* Raising 5 kids (13, 10.5, 8, 5, 2.5) and trying to stay sane ([family blog](http://www.heissatopia.com/))
* Settling into Atlanta as I start a new job as an assistant professor in the [Department of Public Management and Policy](https://aysps.gsu.edu/public-management-policy/) at the [Andrew Young School of Policy Studies](https://aysps.gsu.edu/) at [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu/)
* Teaching [data visualization](https://datavizm20.classes.andrewheiss.com/), [program evaluation](https://evalsp20.classes.andrewheiss.com/), and [microeconomics](https://econs20.classes.andrewheiss.com/) at the [Andrew Young School of Policy Studies](https://aysps.gsu.edu/) at [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu/) during the 2019â€“20 academic year
* Converting my dissertation into multiple articles and sending them out to journals + continuing [my research on authoritarianism and international NGOs](https://www.ingoresearch.org/)
