I'm a visiting assistant professor at the [Romney Institute of Public Management](https://marriottschool.byu.edu/mpa/) at BYU. I study [how international NGO&#8288;s work in authoritarian countries](https://www.ingoresearch.org) and teach courses on data visualization and science communication.

I received a PhD in public policy and political science from Duke University's [Sanford School of Public Policy](http://sanford.duke.edu/) in 2017.
