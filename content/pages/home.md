I'm a visiting assistant professor at the [Romney Institute of Public Service and Ethics](https://marriottschool.byu.edu/mpa/) at Brigham Young University. I received a PhD in public policy and political science from Duke University's [Sanford School of Public Policy](http://sanford.duke.edu/) in 2017.

I study [how international NGOs work in authoritarian countries](https://www.ingoresearch.org/amicable-contempt/), and I received the 2016â€“2018 [Emerging Scholar Dissertation Award](https://www.istr.org/page/DissertationISTR) from the [International Society for Third Sector Research (ISTR)](https://www.istr.org/). I do research in public administration and policy, nonprofit management, international relations, and comparative politics.

I teach courses on [statistics and data science](https://statsf18.classes.andrewheiss.com/), [data](https://datavizf18.classes.andrewheiss.com/) [visualization](https://datavizf17.classes.andrewheiss.com/), [economics](https://econw18.classes.andrewheiss.com/), and [science communication](https://storiesf17.classes.andrewheiss.com/).
