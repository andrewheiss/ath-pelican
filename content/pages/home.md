I'm a PhD candidate at Duke University's [Sanford School of Public Policy](http://sanford.duke.edu/) where I study [how international NGOs work in authoritarian countries](https://www.ingoresearch.org). 

In 2017â€“18 I'll be a visiting assistant professor at the [Romney Institute of Public Management](https://marriottschool.byu.edu/mpa/) at BYU.
